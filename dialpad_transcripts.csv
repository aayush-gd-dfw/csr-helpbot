Especially if we're going to go out and you know, take it out there, install it if we want to move forward on everything. You could be looking at a minimum of, you know, $225 or so, just for something like that you know, just kind of, just so you have that in the back of your mind. I didn't know if you were, if you had any specific, you know, budgets or anything but just so you know, before I kind of move forward on this, is that something that you would be comfortable with or so would want to move forward on?

Miguel Cruz (1:35 PM): Aaron, how are you today?
Erin Smitherman (1:35 PM): I'm doing well. How are you?
Miguel Cruz (1:35 PM): Doing alright, listen, I've got a, I've got a, a little.
Erin Smitherman (1:36 PM): Yeah.
Miguel Cruz (1:36 PM): Not inside the door, it's the actual saa door, right. It was, it had I got the hinges for it and it was in the doorway into the sauna. Had like a two holes in it for the handle, but the door itself was about.
Erin Smitherman (1:36 PM): Okay.
Miguel Cruz (1:36 PM): 51 inches by 2158 that's the opening.
Erin Smitherman (1:36 PM): Okay. Okay. Gotcha. Is this for a home or for a business?
Miguel Cruz (1:37 PM): For a Sana.
Erin Smitherman (1:37 PM): Okay, and a Sana in a house. Okay, perfect, yeah, that's gotcha. Okay. Yeah, that's definitely something we could, you know, take a look at if you wanted to bring it in. We, you could go into our walk in shop which is in Carrollton and you could bring it by to them and, and see it's actually our only walk in shop. All of our other shops are by appointment only. Or we could go ahead and get you set up with an appointment from one of our specialist to take a look at it and build you out an estimate.
Miguel Cruz (1:37 PM): At a house.
Erin Smitherman (1:37 PM): I'm sorry.
Miguel Cruz (1:37 PM): That's the only way, huh.
Erin Smitherman (1:37 PM): Or I mean, you give us the measurements of everything we could.
Miguel Cruz (1:37 PM): Can you give me a rough estimate? What can you give me a rough estimate what that size glass was gonna rate.
Erin Smitherman (1:38 PM): Yeah. What is the sizes I could give you a rough a ballpark.
Miguel Cruz (1:38 PM): Yeah.
Erin Smitherman (1:38 PM): 51.
Miguel Cruz (1:38 PM): Just one glass.
Erin Smitherman (1:38 PM): Single pain. Okay, so I would say for something like this especially since it's kind of in a door. I would say you're probably gonna, yeah, I would say for something like this, you're probably gonna be looking at anywhere from and again this is just to replace the glass anywhere from probably about 400 and up now again.
Miguel Cruz (1:38 PM): Yeah.
Erin Smitherman (1:38 PM): Yeah, and that, that's just for our single pains and that's just for the Neil glass. Now for this is a Sana. So this is probably gonna be tempered glass since it's hot. So if you could be looking, yup, yup. So I would say, yeah, anywhere starting at 400 and up it would be a rough ballpark for something like this.
Miguel Cruz (1:39 PM): That needs to be tampered, right.
Erin Smitherman (1:39 PM): But I mean, again I can, we can go ahead and get you set up for, for a phone quote which is free of charge to you I would just get you set up with a quick account. I would send you over everything that we would need from you would send everything back and we could start you with a, with a phone quote and have our quoting team get that estimate built out for you and we can kind of go from there.
Miguel Cruz (1:40 PM): But when you say all that stuff and like, oh, you know what?
Erin Smitherman (1:40 PM): So the information that I would send you over so, it would be, let me look here. So we would ask for photos of everything we would need. The approximate sizes we would need to know if it's a double pain, single pain, you know, if it's tempered, which clearly it is, you just need to add all that information in there. If it's clear low E., energy efficient or things like that, those are, that's the information. We would need to know. But our quoting team would be able to quote you out based off of that information.
Miguel Cruz (1:40 PM): Yeah, hang on one second can, okay?
Erin Smitherman (1:41 PM): I would send it over to your email or our quoting team would send it over to your email.
Miguel Cruz (1:41 PM): Still on the phone 14.
Erin Smitherman (1:41 PM): Are you still there with me sir?
Miguel Cruz (1:41 PM): Yeah, I'm just looking at something.

Danny (1:39 PM): Yeah.
Goade Chris (1:39 PM): So I have two things for you. I was cleaning an exterior window. There's kind of a picture. We're doing our game room and apparently, I got a little too aggressive. It looks like I might have scratched the surface of it up a little bit, cause I can't get it to. I can't it, I thought it, I thought it was just like some residue of something that I've used everything on it to get it out. So I must have been to I didn't think I had that a brace of, of a, a pad but apparently I did.
Danny (1:39 PM): Mm-hmm.
Goade Chris (1:40 PM): So I'd like to see if I could get that the scratches whatever buffed out, whatever you do or if you even do anything.
Danny (1:40 PM): Mm-hmm.
Goade Chris (1:40 PM): It's on the outside.
Danny (1:40 PM): Okay, was something like that. We would probably just quote you for replacement as we don't offer the service of buffing out scratches but I can definitely set up an appointment for you Mister code.
Goade Chris (1:41 PM): You know, I'm gonna try to buff it out first before I go through the expense of replacing it and then if I can't then I will call you and we'll do that, okay?
Danny (1:41 PM): Sure, sounds, sounds like a deal Mister code.
